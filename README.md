# Font Finder

A tool that analyzes a website and finds the fonts used in it.

## Usage

To use the font finder, simply enter the URL of the website you want to analyze in the text input field and click the submit button. The tool will then display a list of the fonts used in the website along with the source URL for each font.

## Code

The font finder is built using Python and the following libraries:

--> requests for making HTTP requests to the website

--> bs4 (BeautifulSoup) for parsing HTML and extracting the CSS stylesheets

--> streamlit for creating the web interface
